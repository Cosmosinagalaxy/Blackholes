 Blackholes


**Blackholes are cool but did you know this about black holes.** black holes suck in **ANYTHING** even light cant escape.
Honestly thats pretty cool but also **BLACKHOLES** Do you ever wonder about the secrets hidden in space? One of the most mysterious things out there is a black hole. Imagine a place in space where **everything gets sucked in** and nothing not even light, can escape. Thats a black hole. But don't worry they are not like the holes in your socks they are much, much bigger. Black holes are like vacuum cleaners. They are formed when a massive star runs out of fuel and collapses under its gravity. When this happens it becomes so dense that nothing can escape its powerful pull. Even if you light jets out into the blackhole, **the light will get pulled into the black hole**. Scientists call the border of a black hole the "event horizon," and once something crosses this line, it's gone forever.        Even though black holes sound scary we are very far away from them and they dont just go around destroying everything in their path. They are like the huge balls  minding their own business. Scientists are still learning a lot about black holes and they use special telescopes and tools to study these weird holes in space. Who knows what other things we find out about black holes. Maybe one day well know even more about these space wonders.
